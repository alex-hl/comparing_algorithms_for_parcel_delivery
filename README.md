## An Experiment to Compare Algorithms for Parcel Delivery

In this project I have made the use a of a random algorithm and a greedy algorithm to schedule a truck route for parcels delivery. The goal was to analyze which algorithm was most efficient in mapping the truck's route. Some highlights of the steps taken are:
* Using hash tables in order to create a distance map
* Modeling a domain to implement necessary classes
* Implementing the algorithms
